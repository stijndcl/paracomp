# Performance

Assume that we evaluate the performance of two processors (A and B) with different ISAs
using the same workload (i.e., a standardized benchmark with a given reference input). We
obtain the following performance numbers:
- Processor A has a CPI of 2, and executes 4 billion instructions per second.
- Processor B has a CPI of 1, and executes 8 billion instructions per second.

Which processor achieves higher performance on this particular workload? Circle one of the
following answers:
- PROCESSOR A
- PROCESSOR B
- BOTH YIELD THE SAME PERFORMANCE
- NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION TO TELL

Explain your reasoning:

**NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION TO TELL**
- We don't know the total number of instructions.
- We don't know how much an instruction is doing, we only know that the ISA's are _"different"_ so we can't say anything about which will be faster.
- How do both of them relate to each other.
