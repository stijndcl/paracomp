# Register renaming
## Principle
- Goal: remova anti- and output dependences through registers; only real data dependences through registers remain
- By doing so, we archieve the 'data flow limit'
- Architectural registers are renamed to physical/rename registers
- **A physical register is written at most once by an 'in-flight' instruction**
  - **this enables data flow execution through only real data dependences**
- Done completely in HW
  - Don't confuse this with register allocation in the compiler (register allocation: assigning large number of target program variables onto a small number of architectural registers)

every instruction receives a unique target physical register

### Architectural to physical register mapping

### Finit State Machine (FSM) per physcial register

## Implementation

- Initialization
  - All physical registers that map to architectural registers are in the 'architectural register' state
  - All other physical registers are 'available'
- An instruction's input operand(s)
  - Read the physical register that corresponds with the architectural register from the mapping table
- Output operand
  - Select an 'available' physical regiser, and change the state to 'rename register, value not computed'; updatethe mapping table
  - In case there are no more 'available' physical registers, stall the pipeline until physical register become available
- When an instruction finishes its execution on a functional unit --finish
  - Change state to 'rename register, value computed'
- When an instruction leaves the ROB --completion
  - (i) change state of the physical target register to 'architectural register' AND
  - (ii) the physical register previously associated with that same architecture register changes its state to 'available'
    - Old valu is no longer needed (for sure!)
    - (This previous architectural-to-physical register mapping is kept track of in the ROB ; see later)

### Example
AR = architectural register \
AV = available \
RR = rename register

**Instruction 1**

**Instruction 2**

**Instruction 3**

![l3_example_1_4.png](l3_example_1_4.png)

**Instruction 4**

![l3_example_1_5.png](l3_example_1_5.png)

**Instruction 5**

![l3_example_1_6.png](l3_example_1_6.png)

Register renaming now blocks because there are no more physical register available

Assume the first two instructions leave the ROB ...
