## Memory hierarchy fundamentals

### Important concepts
- Locality: spatial, temporal
- Caches: direct-mapped, associative
- Replacement policy (e.g. LRU: least recently used)
- Write-through/back
- Write allocate/non-allocate
- Virtual memory 
- TLB

### Goal of memory hierarchy
- Hide memory latency
- Give the illusion of infinite capacity
- At relatively low cost

### Memory hierarchy
|Component|Technology|Bandwidth|Latency Cost per gigabyte (USD)|
|-|-|-|-|
|**Hard drive**|Magnetic|10+ MB/s|10ms|< 1|
|**Main memory**|DRAM|2+ GB/s|50+ ns|< 200|
|**On-chip L2 cache**|SRAM|10+ GB/s|2+ ns|<100.000|
|**On-chip L1 cache|SRAM**|50+ GB/s|300+ ps|<100.000|
|**Register file**|SRAM with multiple read/write ports|200+ GB/s|300+ ps|>10.000.000 (?)|

### Locality
- Memory hierarchy exploits locality
  - Temporal locality
- Accesses to the same location are likely to occur in near time
  - Spatial locality
- Accesses to nearby locations are likely to occur in near time
  - In both the data and instruction stream
  - Is the case for nearly all computer programs
 
 ### Exploiting locality
 Frequently used data and instructions are stored close to the processor
- In registers
  - done by the compiler
- If not possible, in cache hierarchy (L1, L2, etc.)
  - done by hardware

Infrequently used data and instructions are stored far away from the processor
- Main memory or disk
- Done by the operating system

### Write operations and caches
**Write-through vs write-back**
- Write-through: when writing data to the cache, also write the data to the next level in the hierarchy (L1,L2,L3, cache or main memory)
  - Bandwith hungry
- Write-back: when writing data to the cache, do not write data to the next level in the hierarchy, but mark the cache block as 'dirty'
  - Data is written back upon eviction

**Write-allocate vs. write no-allocate**
- Write-allocate: allocate data in cache
- Write no-allocate: do not allocate in cache

Each level of cache can be either write-through/back and write-allocate/no-allocate

### Typical memory hierarchy
**First level (L1)**
- Split instruction L1 and data L1 caches
  - Why split?
- Small and low associativity
- Access time 1 to 4 clock cycles
- Tag and data array accessed in parallel

**Second level (L2)**
- Unified (instruction and data)
- Larger and higher associativity
- Access time ~10 clock cycles
- Tag and data array accessed serially
- L2 does not see the same accesses as L1
  - L1 acts as a filter (filters some temporal and spatial locality)
  - Management policies are therefore different
